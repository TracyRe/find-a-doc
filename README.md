### Description
When you are sick, you need a doctor. This application will help you locate a doctor in your city who can treat your symptoms and underlying cause. Created for Epicodus Front End Development course.

### Learning Objective
Make API calls and return data to the user.

### Target Audience/Users
* Sick people / people with a medical condition
* Parents of sick children
* People who don't have a primary care physician

### User Stories
**As a** parent,<br>
**I want** to enter my child's symptoms,<br>
**So that** I find a doctor who can treat her.

**As a** parent,<br>
**I want** to know how I can contact doctors,<br>
**So that** I can set up an appointment to see my child.

**As a** patient,<br>
**I want** to see where each doctor is located,<br>
**So that** I can choose the most convenient for me.

**As a** patient,<br>
**I want** to know which doctors are accepting new patients,<br>
**So that** I don't waste time contacting doctors that aren't accepting new patients.

**As a** patient,<br>
**I want** to find a specific doctor,<br>
**So that** I can get information about that doctor.

### Product Requirements
* The user should be able to enter a medical issue and get back a list of doctors, in the Portland area, who treat that issue
* The user should be able to search for a doctor by name
* Doctor information returned needs to include: doctor name (first and last), address, phone number, website, whether doctor is accepting new patients
* When no results are found, the application should give a polite message to that effect

### Non-technical Requirements
* The application should be self-apparent how to use: when people are sick or stressed, their cognitive capacity is reduced

### Assumptions
* Doctors may have multiple practices with multiple phone numbers and addresses
* Practice addresses and phone numbers may be duplicated in the database
* Not all practices list a website
* For the purpose of this project, I will use
 * Only the first practice address available
 * Only the first phone number available in the first practice listed
 * A website only if listed for the first practice listed
